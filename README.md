  If you have read my dni's, were good. My name is Dusky and that's probably the onlt thing i will say about identity. HUGE DoubleFedora shipper and GuestNoob, if you do not like these ships (especially doublefedora) please, don't start a issue about it, it's not your bussines if you dislike it (Yes, ''Leviathan You are so cute C+H'' i know you hate the ship, you don't have to come at random people and scream at them for liking something you don't.). I am multifandom, specially on my X's post's, as i often do skits, fanarts and small animations, this may incluse your fandom such as : Forsaken, roblox admins, minecraft arg's, sfawdde, AReGect, Speedrunner ARG, Eni's highschool AU, Non-Forsaken AU's, Regretevator, Meeleniacs, etc.

*My pronouns - She | Her
*Looking for help for - Art tips
*Ask me about - My interests and mental stability lolz
*FF - I don't appreciate nsfw art, but suggestive is ok for me.
*I am an artist on X and tiktok, feel free to support me or use my strawpage for requests :3

Funfact: I DO NOT know how to interact with people on pony town.

Im mostly afk or offline, if i am online, i am on menu making any cosplay i like. Please, do not bother me on a conversation, but i am comfortable if you want to include me or yourself. I can yap too much while talking, so expect me to stay silent from time to time. Multifandom cosplays, don't expect me to have a OC of my own, as i am not interested in making one or in the future.

- 1 - As multifandom i am, im Multishipper.
- 2 - Don't be rude unless on character.
- 3 - I like roleplaying unless it's suggestive.
- 4 - I mostly talk cold or robotic, keep in mind that.
- 5 - I use # on my skins, they are permanent.
